Solutions to print out managerial hierarchy. 

I provided two different ways to approach the problem: 
1. Purely through HashMap
2. A combination of tree and HashMap

Several assumptions are made with regards to the input file, which are 
as follows:
1. The file is divided onto lines
2. Each line will not be empty, and will always contain two names, 
   separated by commas
3. Each name will be one word and contains no space
4. The relationship is always between the superior (whose name comes 
   after comma), and the subordinate of the said superior (name comes 
   before comma)

Two classes are defined here: 
1. EmployeeHashMap: an extension of HashMap<String, String>, ensures 
   that the put method will throw an error if an attempt is made to 
   replace the value associated with a particular existing key. This 
   implies that an employee has more than two supervisors. 
   It also ensures that a cycle can never happen as a tree should not 
   contain a cycle. 
2. EmployeeTree: a simple tree class which has a String as the value 
   for each node, and it contains references to a list for the children 
   nodes
